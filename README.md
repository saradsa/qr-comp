## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS
- SASS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to do nesting in SASS.

```css
#main {
  display: flex;
  #content {
    height: 45vh;
    h1 {
      font-size: 1.2em;
    }
  }
}
```

Along with that I learned how to use semantic HTML
markups.

```html
<main>
  <section></section>
  <footer></footer>
</main>
```

Also I got to know about new design concepts like neumorphism.

### Continued development

After completion of this project, I'll try to focus more on mobile-first workflow and focus more on responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me understand the use cases and overall documentation of Bootstrap.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing website where you can clear any doubts related to HTML, CSS, Jacascript and other languages and technologies.
